This repository contains the backend infrastructure for the application, built using a **Microservices Architecture**. The system is divided into independent services handling specific domains, routed through a central API Gateway.

## 📂 Service Architecture

The project is organized into the following distinct microservices:

```text
root/
├── API-GATEWAY/      # Entry point for all client requests (Proxy)
├── USER-AUTH/        # Handles User Registration, Login, and JWT generation
├── NOTES-CRUD/       # Core logic for creating, reading, updating, deleting notes
├── NOTIFICATION/     # Manages alerts, emails, or push notifications
└── AGENTIC-AI/       # AI service for processing intelligent tasks/agents
```
